Polygon provides a `ConvexHull` type, which represents the convex hull of a set
of 2D points by its extreme points. Functionality includes:

* convexity test
* construction of a convex hull given a set of points
* area
* centroid
* point-in-convex-hull test
* closest point within convex hull
* equivalent halfspace representation of the convex hull
